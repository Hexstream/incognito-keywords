incognito-keywords introduces a new kind of keyword that looks just
like any non-keyword symbol and allows safe usage of convenient but
clashy symbol names by multiple libraries without conflicts through
sharing. Some names that might benefit are (alist blist plist macro
operator index &doc &decl &rest+ &destructure &ignored &ignorable).
